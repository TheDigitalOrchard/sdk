[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/php-watson/sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/php-watson/sdk)

Our goal is to create a solid, tested and easy to use SDK for developers to use the IBM Watson Services in your PHP projects.

> **Note: This project is at an early stage of development and should not be used for production. Things will change and things will break constantly**

# Contributing

If you like contribute, you can help us testing the SDK and report possible bugs and unexpected behaviour

When reach a stable state we would like to migrate the package to [watson-developer-cloud organization](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud) for better serve the community
